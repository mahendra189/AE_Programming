## Experiment 6:
Interfacing of LED with Arduino Uno kit.
- A) Blink 1 LED with predetermine timing for ON and OFF  **[Code](./Experiment%206/A.ino)**
- B) Blink 2 or 4 LED’s with predetermine timing for ON and OFF (together and alternately)  **[Code](./Experiment%206/B.ino)**
- C) Blink minimum 7-8 LED’s to switch ON and OFF sequentially in both directions  **[Code](./Experiment%206/C.ino)**
- D) To simulate working of traffic signal for two three-way roads. Formulate your own theme and delay cycle Decide the hardware required and assemble the same on a breadboard for your theme  **[Code](./Experiment%206/D.ino)**

## Experiment 7:
Interfacing of LDR with ARDUINO UNO kit.
- A) Interface LDR with the UNO kit such that when you cover the LDR surface, an LED will glow indicating night hours. When uncovered, the LED should switch OFF.  **[Code](./Experiment%207/A.ino)**
- B) To implement an automated street light ON/OFF system depending upon ambient light intensity. Use at least 3 LEDs as street lights.  **[Code](./Experiment%207/B.ino)**
- C) To count the number of objects passing through. The system should use light source (LED) and detector (LDR). Initially, the count should be zero, and with every object passing, it should be incremented by '1'. Display the count on the serial monitor.  **[Code](./Experiment%207/C.ino)**

## Experiment 8:
Interfacing of ultrasonic sensor with Arduino Uno kit.
- A) To find distance (in cm) between the sensor and a fixed surface like an obstacle or wall, etc. Display the distance on the Serial monitor. Verify the distance by actual measurement.  **[Code](./Experiment%208/A.ino)**
- B) Give alert using Buzzer and LED. If the distance goes above or below a predetermined level.  **[Code](./Experiment%208/B.ino)**
- C) Ultrasonic distance between two ranges finding and turn ON appropriate LED.  **[Code](./Experiment%208/C.ino)**

## Experiment 9:
16x2 LCD Interfacing with Arduino Uno Kit
- A) Write a program to display Hello World! On LCD at the desired location.  **[Code](./Experiment%209/A.ino)**
- B) Write a program to scroll custom messages in the Right or Left direction on LCD.  **[Code](./Experiment%209/B.ino)**
- C) Write a program to display custom characters on LCD.  **[Code](./Experiment%209/C.ino)**
- D) Display distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor.  **[Code](./Experiment%209/D.ino)**

## Experiment 11:
IR sensor interfacing with Arduino Uno
- A) Write a program to interface IR sensor so as to display the presence of an obstacle on the serial monitor.  **[Code](./Experiment%2011/A.ino)**

## Experiment 12:
Seven Segment Display Interfacing with Arduino
- A) Write a program to turn ON and turn OFF the individual LED. ❌  **[Code](./Experiment%2012/A.ino)**
- B) Write a program to implement simple decimal counter (Counting 0 to 9) using a 7 Segment Display.  **[Code](./Experiment%2012/B.ino)**
- C) Form Special Character of Your choice and Display.  **[Code](./Experiment%2012/C.ino)**

## Experiment 13:
Servo Motor Interfacing with Arduino
- A) Write a program to control the Servo Motor Rotation by one Degree using Arduino Uno.  **[Code](./Experiment%2013/A.ino)**
- B) Write a program to control Servo Motor Rotation Control using a potentiometer.  **[Code](./Experiment%2013/B.ino)**
- C) Write a program to rotate the servo through given degrees. Accept commands from a cell phone via Bluetooth.  **[Code](./Experiment%2013/C.ino)**

## Experiment 14:
DC Motor Interfacing with Arduino
- A) Write a program to control DC motor clockwise & anti-clockwise rotation control using a push button.  **[Code](./Experiment%2014/A.ino)**
- B) Write a program to control the Speed of DC Motor Rotation using a potentiometer or H bridge.  **[Code](./Experiment%2014/B.ino)**
