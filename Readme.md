## Experiment 6:
Interfacing of LED with Arduino Uno kit.
- A) Blink 1 LED with predetermine timing for ON and OFF
- B) Blink 2 or 4 LED’s with predetermine timing for ON and OFF (together and alternately)
- C) Blink minimum 7-8 LED’s to switch ON and OFF sequentially in both directions
- D) To simulate working of traffic signal for two three way road. Formulate your own theme and delay cycle Decide the hardware required and assemble the same on a breadboard for your theme



## Experiment 7:
Interfacing of LDR with ARDUINO UNO kit.
- A) : Interface LDR with the UNO kit such that when you cover the LDR surface, an LED will glow
indicating night hours. When uncovered , the LED should switch OFF.
- B) To implement automated street light ON OFF system depending upon at ambient light intensity.
Use at least 3-LESs as street Light.
- C) To count number of objects passing through. The system should use light source (LED) and
detector (LDR). Initially count should be. Zero and with every object passing it should be
incremented by '1' Display the count on serial monitor of the serial monitor.

## Experiment 8:
Interfacing of ultrasonic sensor with Arduino Uno kit.
- A) To find distance (in cm) between the sensor and fixed surface like obstacle or wall etc. Display the distance on Serial monitor. Verity the distance by actual measurement.
- B) Give alert using Buzzer and LED. If distance goes above or below a predetermined level
- C) Ultrasonic distance between two ranges finding and turn ON appropriate LED


## Experiment 9:
16x2 LCD Interfacing with Arduino Uno Kit
- A) Write a program to display Hello World! On LCD at desired location
- B) Write a program to scroll custom message on Right or Left direction on LCD.
- C) Write a program to display custom characters on LCD
- D) Display distance measured by ultrasonic sensor.


## Experiment 11:
IR sensor interfacing with Arduino Uno
- A) Write a program to interface IR sensor so as to display the presence of obstacle on serial
monitor.

## Experiment 12:
Seven Segment Display Interfacing with Arduino

- A) Write a program to turn ON and turn OFF the individual LED.❌
- B) Write a program to implement simple decimal counter (Counting 0 to 9) using a 7 Segment
Display.
- C) Form Special Character of Your choice and Display.
## Experiment 13:
Servo Motor Interfacing with Arduino
- A) Write a program to control the Servo Motor Rotation by one Degree using Arduino Uno
- B) Write a program to control Servo Motor Rotation Control using potentiometer.
- C) Write a program to rotate servo through given degrees. Accept Command from cell phone
via blue tooth.


## Experiment 14:
DC Motor Interfacing with Arduino
- A) Write a program to control DC motor clockwise & anti clockwise rotation control using a push
button.
- B) Write a program to control Speed of DC Motor Rotation using a potentiometer or H bridge.
